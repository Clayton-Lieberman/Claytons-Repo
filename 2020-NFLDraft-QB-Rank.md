Tua is undoubtably the most talented quarterback from the draft. It is not an exaggeration to say that we have never seen him play "bad" football. Selected 5th overall by the Dolphins, the greatest concern is his health. He has had numerous serious injuries in his young career. Most recently, a fractured hip ended his 2019 college season. If he is healthy, Tua's ceiling is an elite NFL QB.

**2.  Joe Burrow**

Burrow has a winning pedigree. National Champion, Heisman, and most recently 1st overall pick for the Bengals. He put up big numbers on LSU's elite offense this year. His pocket presence was excellent; he showed great accuracy and arm strength, and his respectable athleticism make him unlikely to bust. The concerns are that it took him until his senior year to even be in the conversation for a first round pick. 23 years old (the same age as reigning NFL MVP Lamar Jackson) is pretty old to become a standout college player. Moreover, LSU stacked receiving core undoubtable helped inflate his passing numbers.

**3. Jordan Love**

A contraversial pick by the Packers, Love is seen as the successor to future HOFer Aaron Rogers. As a quarterback, Love is...inconsistant. He threw 32 TD's and 6 INT's his sophemore year. Very impressive. His junior year, his numbers dropped significantly: 20 TD's, 17 INT's. This is concerning to many.
