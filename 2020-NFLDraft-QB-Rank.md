Tua is undoubtably the most talented quarterback from the draft. It is not an exaggeration to say that we have never seen him play "bad" football. Selected 5th overall by the Dolphins, the greatest concern is his health. He has had numerous serious injuries in his young career. Most recently, a fractured hip ended his 2019 college season. If he is healthy, Tua's ceiling is an elite NFL QB.

**2.  Joe Burrow**
